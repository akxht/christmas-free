    <h1>Happy New Year, Hanna 🤍</h1>
    <p>
  Thank you for coming into my life.<br>
  You didn’t just make me smile — you made things feel lighter.<br><br>
  Thank you for understanding me in ways I don’t always say out loud,
  for standing by me, and for caring in the quiet ways that matter most.<br><br>
  I appreciate you more than you know.<br>
  I love you — deeply and sincerely.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.7;">
  You didn’t arrive loudly,<br>
  you arrived gently —<br>
  and somehow that changed everything.<br><br>

  With you, I learned that love<br>
  doesn’t rush or demand,<br>
  it stays, it listens,<br>
  it understands even the silences.<br><br>

  You make the world feel steadier,<br>
  not perfect — just honest.<br>
  Like I don’t have to pretend,<br>
  or explain myself twice.<br><br>

  In your presence, I’m calmer.<br>
  In your care, I’m seen.<br>
  And in choosing you,<br>
  I choose a place that feels like home.<br><br>

  This year, and every year after,<br>
  I don’t ask for more —<br>
  I just choose you.
